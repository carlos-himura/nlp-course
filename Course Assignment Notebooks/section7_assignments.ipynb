As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories. But it is only when the deadly and corrupt forces that run the city come after Alita that she discovers a clue to her past - she has unique fighting abilities that those in power will stop at nothing to control.

When Alita (Rosa Salazar) awakens with no memory of who she is in a future world she does not recognize, she is taken in by Ido (Christoph Waltz), a compassionate doctor who realizes that somewhere in this abandoned cyborg shell is the heart and soul of a young woman with an extraordinary past. As Alita learns to navigate her new life and the treacherous streets of Iron City, Ido tries to shield her from her mysterious history while her street-smart new friend Hugo (Keean Johnson) offers instead to help trigger her memories.

If she can stay out of their grasp, she could be the key to saving her friends, her family and the world she's grown to love.   \n",

As the boy grows up, he takes more from the tree, and the tree continues to give, even when it has little left. Silverstein’s minimalist text and illustrations convey deep themes of unconditional love, selflessness, and the passage of time. It has sparked much discussion about relationships and sacrifice.   \n",

As the boy grows up, he takes more from the tree, and the tree continues to give, even when it has little left. Silverstein’s minimalist text and illustrations convey deep themes of unconditional love, selflessness, and the passage of time. It has sparked much discussion about relationships and sacrifice.   \n",

Through repetition and rhyme, Dr. Seuss’s classic story about being open to new experiences encourages children to be adventurous and try things outside their comfort zone. The playful illustrations and humorous dialogue make it a fun and educational read for young readers.   \n",
